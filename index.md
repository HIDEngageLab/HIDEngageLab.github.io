The VariKey platform (created by [HIDengageLab][hidengagelab-organization]) is a highly customizable keypad solution that combines a key matrix and a microcontroller. 
The firmware of this platform enables not only the control of a small display but also the management of smart LEDs for backlighting.  
Control is facilitated through the HID protocol, allowing for seamless integration.
